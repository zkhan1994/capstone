                Halo is a comprehensive volunteer management application (VMA) developed to address specific needs
                identified by Angels Among Us Pet Rescue (AAU). AAU's current system is unable to effectively manage and
                store complex volunteer information, limiting its effectiveness. As the organization’s needs evolved,
                AAU required a more robust and secure solution to handle volunteer information efficiently. Our team
                designed Halo using the React.js library for the frontend, the Python based FastAPI framework for the
                backend, and a PostgreSQL database schema, with Docker containerization to ensure consistent deployment
                across environments. This setup enables efficient management of volunteer and team data, along with
                support for exporting reports in both .csv and .xlsx formats. To address security, Halo incorporates
                role-based access control (RBAC), differentiating access for administrators, editors, and viewers. We
                also implemented a Google Sign-On feature with JSON web tokens (JWT) to validate users' Google login
                information within the database. Additionally, an Extract, Transfer, and Load (ETL) script facilitates
                secure data requests directly on the server. Halo’s frontend offers an intuitive interface designed to
                enhance user experience, with extensive search and filtering capabilities that make it easy to access
                and manage volunteer data. These improvements result in faster query responses and a substantial boost
                in usability compared to AAU's previous system.
